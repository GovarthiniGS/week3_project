    The objective of my project is to understand its patterns, risk factors, and potential preventive measures, thereby having a significant impact on public health.

    To analyze who got more affected by heart disease and what are the factors.

# Dataset

    I took the dataset from kaggle.
- What are the main issues of the dataset
    As, this is medical concept I am little aware of some concepts. 
- How did you solve the main issues?
    I just did a research with interest and tried to understand the concepts.


# Conclusions

    From this dataset, we have identified that male above 50 has affected more with heart disease 

    Business case: Male patients before the age of 50 who have either a cholesterol , blood pressure or diabetes could be tested for heart problems(For eg: from age 48). With this we can prevent the heart disease and the hospitals can also treat the patients effectively.

    Death rate can be prevented because of the early preventive measures

    Doctors can collaborate with each other (Blood pressure doctor, Diabetes doctor and heart specialist doctor(Cardiologist) 

    Collaboration with physiotherapist, dieticians and Yoga centers
